# Are you Smarter than a Bootcamp Student?
I was asked to create a quiz using Javascript and it was fun!

##  Project Description
Admittedly,  I had trouble with this project. But I think it turned out as good as it could. I had fun with the HTML and the styling of it but the javascript was hard. I am still getting the hang of functions but I feel like I was able to grasp it a little bit better than the last project. It's still going to take more practice. 

It was fun adding the timer and figuing out how to decrement time for wrong answers. I hope to continue to get better at Javascript as I do it more!
